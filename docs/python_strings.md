In Python, a string is a sequence of Unicode characters. Unicode was introduced to include every character in all languages and bring uniformity in encoding.

## **String Creation**
Python provides multiple number of ways to create a string literal

    #String Creation

    #Enclosed with single quotes
    single_quoted_data = 'I am created with single quote'
    print(single_quoted_data)

    #Enclosed with double quotes
    double_quoted_data = "I am created with double quotes"
    print(double_quoted_data)

    #Enslosed with trible single quotes
    trible_single_quoted_data = '''I am created
    with
    trible single quotes'''
    print(trible_single_quoted_data)

    #Enslosed with trible double quotes
    trible_double_quoted_data = """I am created
    with
    trible double quotes"""
    print(trible_double_quoted_data)

 Output

    I am created with single quote
    I am created with double quotes
    I am created
    with
    trible single quotes
    I am created
    with
    trible double quotes
