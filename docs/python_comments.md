Every programming language having the facility for comments.   Python also provides the best commenting system which is used to increase the readability of the code

## **Types of Comments**

    1. Single Line Comments
    2. Docstring Comments
    3. Multiline Comments

## **Single Line Comments**
Use the hash symbol to write a single-line comment

    #Single Line Comment
    print("I'm print statement with single line comment")

 Output

    I'm print statement with single line comment

## **Docstring Comments**
We can use multi-line docstrings as multiline comments. A multi-line docstring starts with triple quotes (""") and ends with triple quotes (""")

    """The multline comment
    using
    Docstring method"""
    print("I'm print statement with Docstring comment")

 Output

    I'm print statement with Docstring comment

## **Multi Line Comments**
Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments. We should insert # for each line or use the above mentioned Docstring method to add a multi line comments

    # The multline comment
    # by insersting hash
    # in each line of cdde
    print("I'm print statement with Multiline comment")

 Output

    I'm print statement with Multiline comment
